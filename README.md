## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to identify types of bacteria that are able to synthesize proteins to taste like beef. Labs around the world have synthesized proteins such as these from algae, fungi, and microorganisms and our focus is to now find them through bacteria. It is theorized that this protein can be found on the human body in a person's naval. However, every person is different and may contain different kinds of bacteria. In this analysis a dashboard is created to display the information of the types of bacteria found in a person's belly button. A participant in the study can go to this website and use the dropdown meny to find their unique id number to display information on the top 10 bacterias found, the types of bacteria found, and how frequenty their naval is washed. This is a tool to display findings to volunteers and serve as a location for information to other researchers who may also be interested in discovering this new protein. 

## Results
Using Plotly, Javascript, and HTML together, a series of graphs and charts are created to display our desired information based on an id number being chosen. The HTML file is then deployed using Github Pages.
